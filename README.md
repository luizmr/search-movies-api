## üíª About project

Personal project built to search every movie you want. First, you just need to write any word and any page number, which will return 20 results. There other categories for searching movies, like Top rated, upcoming, now playing and popular movies, which you just need to write a page number. In these cases, the number one is the first page and will return in a descending order:

-   most top rated movies
-   most popular movies
-   most recent movies which are playing
-   most recent movies which will be released
-   and you can access the movie details and even the imdb page of the movie selected

The movie api used in this project just return 20 results per page, which is accessed using axios.
Sometimes is hard to find a good movie to watch on weekend, so with this app you can search for everything you wanted and find a good movie easily. Feel free to use this project and get new ideas for your next project.
